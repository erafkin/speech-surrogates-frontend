      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This site is dedicated to sharing research and resources related to speech surrogates,
        especially musical surrogate languages. In 2013, I stumbled into the topic by accident during a field trip to Burkina Faso,
        where I had begun a language documentation project on Seenku, the language of the Sambla ethnicity.
        My collaborators brought me the music of <a href="https://www.mamadoudiabate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mamadou Diabate</a>,
        a master of the Sambla balafon (resonator xylophone). The music consists of three densely woven parts played on the same instrument,
        resulting in a thick tapestry of sound that can be hard for a naive listener to parse.
      </p>

        As a linguist, I am interested first and foremost in words,
        and so this instrumental tradition, while quite beautiful,
        looked like a dead end from a research perspective—until my collaborator casually mentioned,
        “I know what the balafon is saying.”
      </p>

        This was the “aha” moment that ignited my interest in the topic of speech surrogates.
        How can music encode speech? What purpose do these musical messages serve? Can any instrument do it?
        Can any language be turned into a musical surrogate? The answers to these questions are complex and nuanced,
        and they stand to shed light on fundamental questions of linguistic representation, human communicative practices,
        and metalinguistic knowledge (what people know about their language).

        2020 marks the
        start of a new <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1943896&HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> NSF CAREER grant</a> focused on
        musical surrogate languages.
        This site is designed as a resource for both academics and the broader public interested in
        learning more and keeping up to date with our findings. We will be linking primary audio and video,
        in addition to keeping a blog, open to guest contributors. Blog entries are tagged for target audience,
        based on the amount of background knowledge the post assumes.
